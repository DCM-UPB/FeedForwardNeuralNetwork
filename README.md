#FeedForwardNeuralNetwork

C++ Library for building and using a Feed Forward Neural Network.
It includes first and second derivatives in respect to the input values, and first derivatives in respect to the variational parameters.

In `doc/` there is a user manual in pdf.

In `examples/` there are several examples (STILL TO BE DONE).



#Build the library

Insert the system parameters in the `config.sh` and then simply execute the command

   `./build.sh`
